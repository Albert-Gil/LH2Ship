## 🚢 Project Overview

Large cruise ships present a significant decarbonization challenge due to their high power demand for both propulsion and hotel loads. This project evaluates a **Hydrogen Tri-Generation System** that dynamically integrates:

* **⚡ Electricity**: Generated by **Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs)** for propulsion and ship services.
* **🔥 Heating**: Recovered from PEMFC waste heat and supplemented by a **catalytic hydrogen burner**.
* **❄️ Cooling**: Recovered from the **gasification process of liquid hydrogen (LH₂)**.



By simultaneously balancing electrical and thermal demands over a **7-day representative cruise**, the system achieves high overall efficiency without onboard carbon emissions.

### Propulsion Load Estimation
The propulsion power demand profiles were estimated using a resistance and power prediction model based on the **Holtrop and Mennen method**.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup

Open MATLAB, navigate to the repository root directory, and add all subfolders to the MATLAB path:

```matlab
addpath(genpath(pwd));
```

---

### 2. Option A – Quick Analysis (No Simulation Required)

If you want to reproduce the figures **without re-running the full Simulink models**, pre-computed results are provided.

- Reproduce voyage-level results:
  ```matlab
  run Analysis/LH2Ship_Plots_Compare_Scenarios.m
  ```

- Visualize PEM fuel cell characterization:
  ```matlab
  run Analysis/PEMFC_Model_Plots.m
  ```

---

### 3. Option B – Full Simulation (Run the Models)

To modify assumptions or re-run the full dynamic simulations:

1. **Generate PEMFC lookup tables**
   ```matlab
   run Models/PEMFC_Model.m
   ```

2. **Load input data**
   ```matlab
   load('Data/Inputs/LH2Ship_Simulink_Summer_inputdata.mat')
   ```

3. **Run Simulink model**
   - Open and run:
     ```
     Models/LH2Ship_Simulink_Summer.slx
     ```
     or
     ```
     Models/LH2Ship_Simulink_Winter.slx
     ```

4. **Post-process results**
   ```matlab
   run Analysis/LH2Ship_Rename_Workspace.m
   ```

## Scope and Limitations

- System-level **feasibility and architecture assessment**
- No CFD, structural, or naval architecture modeling
- Hydrogen bunkering and boil-off not dynamically resolved
- Not intended for class certification or safety-critical design
