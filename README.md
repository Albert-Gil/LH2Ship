## Project Overview

Large cruise ships present a significant decarbonization challenge due to their high power demand for both **propulsion** and **hotel loads**.  
This project evaluates a **Hydrogen Tri-Generation System** that dynamically integrates:

- **Electricity**  
  Generated by **Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs)** to supply propulsion and onboard electrical services.

- **Heating**  
  Recovered from PEMFC waste heat and supplemented by a **catalytic hydrogen burner**.

- **Cooling**  
  Recovered from the **gasification process of liquid hydrogen (LH₂)**.

By simultaneously balancing electrical and thermal demands over a **7-day representative cruise**, the system achieves high overall efficiency without onboard carbon emissions.

### Propulsion Load Estimation

The propulsion power demand profiles used in this study were estimated using a resistance and power prediction model based on the **Holtrop and Mennen method**. This empirical approach, widely used in naval architecture, estimates ship resistance and required propulsion power based on hull geometry and operational conditions.

The propulsion model is available in a separate repository:  
**[Ship-Propulsion-Power-Simulator](https://github.com/Albert-Gil/Ship-Propulsion-Power-Simulator)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB **R2020a or newer**
- Simulink
- Simscape / Simscape Electrical

---

## How to Use

### 1. Setup

Open MATLAB, navigate to the repository root directory, and add all subfolders to the MATLAB path:

```matlab
addpath(genpath(pwd));
```

---

### 2. Option A – Quick Analysis (No Simulation Required)

If you want to reproduce the figures **without re-running the full Simulink models**, pre-computed results are provided.

- Reproduce voyage-level results:
  ```matlab
  run Analysis/LH2Ship_Plots_Compare_Scenarios.m
  ```

- Visualize PEM fuel cell characterization:
  ```matlab
  run Analysis/PEMFC_Model_Plots.m
  ```

---

### 3. Option B – Full Simulation (Run the Models)

To modify assumptions or re-run the full dynamic simulations:

1. **Generate PEMFC lookup tables**
   ```matlab
   run Models/PEMFC_Model.m
   ```

2. **Load input data**
   ```matlab
   load('Data/Inputs/LH2Ship_Simulink_Summer_inputdata.mat')
   ```

3. **Run Simulink model**
   - Open and run:
     ```
     Models/LH2Ship_Simulink_Summer.slx
     ```
     or
     ```
     Models/LH2Ship_Simulink_Winter.slx
     ```

4. **Post-process results**
   ```matlab
   run Analysis/LH2Ship_Rename_Workspace.m
   ```
